# Learn Programming Skills

Welcome! This repository is dedicated to learning and practicing different programming skills through hands-on projects and code samples. The focus is on Python, data, cloud, ETL, and general programming concepts.

## Repository Structure

- **python/**: Projects, exercises, and demos in Python.
  - **misc_projects/**: Small, self-contained Python projects (e.g., games, utilities, scripts).
  - **oop/**: Object-Oriented Programming examples and exercises.
  - **streamlit/**: Interactive web apps and data visualizations using Streamlit.
- **web_scrape/**: Data scraping projects, such as extracting apartment listings from community web pages.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/learn_programing.git
   cd learn_programing
   ```
2. **Explore the folders**
   - Each folder contains a README or comments to help you get started with the specific project or topic.
3. **Run Python projects**
   - Most projects require Python 3.8+.
   - (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
     # or
     venv\Scripts\activate    # On Windows
     ```
   - Install dependencies as needed (see project README or requirements.txt).
